# college-placement-system
This project is a simple C-based College Placement System that helps match students with companies based on their CGPA, skills, and location preferences. It allows users to:

Register students and companies
View registered students and companies
Edit student and company details
Match students with companies based on specific criteria (CGPA, skills, location)

The system uses a basic console interface and supports multiple features to simulate a real-world placement system.
